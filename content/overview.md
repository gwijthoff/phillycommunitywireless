<p class="f3">Formed in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, Philly Community Wireless (PCW) is building community-owned and -operated internet infrastructures in order to democratize access, promote digital literacy, and fight digital inequity with free, net-neutral broadband service in North Philadelphia.</p>

We are a collective impact initiative consisting of allied community organizations based primarily in the neighborhoods of Fairhill and Kensington. Over the next two years, we are partnering with residents, nonprofits, and immigrant/LEP communities in **Norris Square Park** to incubate a new model of community-based network stewardship that can spread throughout the City of Philadelphia.
