      <description>In this meeting, we heard from 1) Meta Mesh in Pittsburg, 2) Community Tech NY, 3) Andrew Coy in Baltimore, and 4) we discussed some Philly specific planning.
  Adam Longwill, part of Meta Mesh, tells the group about PittMesh, a community wireless network in Pittsburgh under the auspices of non-profit Meta Mesh Wireless Communities. Adam advises that the network installation and maintenance should be left to the non-profit due to the intense work of building the network and the high expenditure of resources needed to educate a community on network maintenance.</description>
